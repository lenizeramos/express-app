# Express Server

This project focuses on creating an Express server that simulates endpoints similar to those found in [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). The objective is to replicate `/posts` and `/comments` endpoints.

> Please avoid making direct requests to `{JSON} Placeholder` within your server. Instead, replicate the endpoints and handle data internally.

## Requirements

1. **Server Setup:**

   - Utilize Express to establish a server.
   - Build possibly with `Typescript`

2. **Implementation of Routes for BREAD Operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE):**

   - Develop endpoints for each operation.
   - Implement corresponding request handlers.

3. **Usage of In-Memory Variables for Data Storage:**

   > As a temporary measure until a database is introduced.

   - Create a constant (array) to store data, such as `const data = [...]`.

4. **Submission:**
   - Merge your branch into the `main` branch.

**Note:** Ensure thorough error handling and appropriate status codes are incorporated into your server for enhanced robustness.
